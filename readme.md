## Introduction

Web3Modal is an easy-to-use library to help developers add support for multiple providers in their apps with a simple customizable configuration. This library leverages WalletConnect V2 client ([repo](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/), [docs](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/introduction/sign/)) and [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/).

By default Web3Modal library supports providers like:

- **Metamask**
- **Injected**
- **WalletConnect**
- **Coinbase Wallet**
- **Ledger**
- and many more to be added

## Quick Start

Getting started with web3modal is as easy as installing few packages, one for your prefared front-end framework i.e. `@web3modal/react` and chain ecosystem you are working with i.e `@web3modal/ethereum`. We will be expanding support to more choices very soon.

### 1. Obtain your WalletConnect projectId

Head over to [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) to sign up and generate your projectId, which will be required to allow interactions with our explorer api and v2 protocol sdk's in the future.

### 2. Follow instructions and examples for your favourite framework

- [React Docs](./packages/react/) / [React Example](./examples/react/)
- Vue Docs / Vue Example (coming soon)
- Angular Docs / Angular Example (coming soon)
- Vanilla JS Docs / Vanila JS Example (coming soon)

### 5. Customise your modal!

Web3Modal exposes some config options that allow you to personalise it and make it fit in better with your dapp's ui. As of now supported config options are specified below, but more are on the way!
